# Mother Earth
 Mother Earth has been developed as part of Code Institute's April 2022 Hackathon.
Mother earth helps you plan for a more sustainable future in a playful way through simple tips, quiz, events, rewards.
By raising self-awareness we can enable peole to reconnect to themselves ,reconnect to nature and truly comprehend humanity's impact on the planet by creating
a quiz app feature, tree planting donation feature and some extra resources.
The team members for this project were: Nigel Doberer, Salwin Achankunju_5P, Yusuf F, Jochen Mayer, Eugenia Muscat & Sandra Atino under the guidance of our facilitator, DaveHorrocks_ci.

### Typography

 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to select the fonts.
  * The main font used throughout the site is '---------' which belongs to the sans-serif typeface family. The font is clean and elegant, making it a good choice for web design.

 * We have used the '---------------' font for titles and headers all over the site.

 * Sans Serif is set as the fallback font if for any reason the main fonts aren't being imported into the site correctly.

## Deployment

The following steps were followed to deploy the project to a live website in GitHub, using Github Pages:

- Ensure changes have been added and commited in Gitpod and pushed to GitHub.
- Login to GitHub.
- Locate the relevant repository on GitHub. This is the repository for...
- At the top of the repository, locate the 'Settings' link and click on this.
- On the left of the page, under Options, scroll down until you get to Pages and click on Pages.
- Under Source, in the first box called "None", click the dropdown and select "master".
- Then select Save.
- The page will refresh and you will see a link above the Save button. This is the link to the live site. Note that it may take a few minutes for the site to be deployed.
- There are no differences between the deployed version and the development version of this project.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
The repository can be forked on GitHub, this creates a copy of the repository that can be viewed or amended without affecting the original repository. This can be done using the following steps:

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- At the top right of the repository (under your avatar) locate the Fork button and click this button.
- There should now be a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, which you can amend.

### Cloning the GitHub Repository
A clone of the repository can be made, which will create a local copy on your own computer. Changes can be made to this local copy and it will not affect the original repository. Follow these steps to clone the Sunrise Yoga repository.

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- Click the button called "Code".
- Under HTTPS copy the link provided, in this case ().
- Go to Gitpod or whichever IDE you are using and open the Terminal.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type 'git clone' followed by the url you copied in step 3.
- Press "Enter" to create the local clone.
- You can refer to the GitHub documentation for more detailed information on the above process [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
